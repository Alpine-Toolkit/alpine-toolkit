<div style="background: wheat; width: 50em"><p>PROJ.4 has been placed under an MIT license. I believe this to be as close as possible to public domain while satisfying those who say that a copyright notice is required in some countries. The COPYING file read as follows:</p><p>All source, data files and other contents of the PROJ.4 package are available under the following terms. Note that the PROJ 4.3 and earlier was "public domain" as is common with US government work, but apparently this is not a well defined legal term in many countries. I am placing everything under the following MIT style license because I believe it is effectively the same as public domain, allowing anyone to use the code as they wish, including making proprietary derivatives.</p><p>Though I have put my own name as copyright holder, I don't mean to imply I did the work. Essentially all work was done by Gerald Evenden.</p></div>

All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of <a href="https://www.hwaci.com">Hwaci</a>.  Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.</p><p>The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application.  Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.</p><p>All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file.  So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.</p></div>
